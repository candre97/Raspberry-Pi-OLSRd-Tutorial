Tutorial on how to setup Raspberry Pi with OLSRd mesh network

Background: 
I am doing research on Campus at USC's Autonomous Networks Research Group. We're working on coordinated localization of robots related to the DARPA SubT challenge (https://www.darpa.mil/program/darpa-subterranean-challenge)
In order to allow devices to communicate over longer distance and multiple hops, naturally we had to set up a mesh network. 
The one in this tutorial is WiFi based, but I am definitely interested in replicating this using Radios. 

I cannot guarantee that all of the steps will be the same if you do not have the same operating system on your Raspberry Pi. For this reason, step one will be setting up the same OS that I was using. 

Step 1: Raspbian Setup
Follow the guide on this webpage

If you would like to setup your Raspberry Pi in Headless mode, all you need to do is configure your WiFi settings and allow for ssh.
